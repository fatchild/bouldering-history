A place to tell document the story of bouldering in all of its areas and origins.

- climbing-history.org does a good job of the top ascents and the top plays as far back as the 2000 ish.

- I want this site to come at it from the other direction and have less bias toward the top end. Though that is the story that often has the most influential effect on the culture.


TECH OPTIONS
- https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack https://www.bookstackapp.com/, it's opinionated and I want to make changes
- 


Needs to cover the following areas
- Climbers
- Climbs
- Articles - Notes and stories on history and culture
- Areas
- Timelines and associations 

If you have the dates active, associations, dates climbs were climbed, you can create a map of the history of climbing visually
